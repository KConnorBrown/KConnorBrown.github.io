	<h1>Hi there, I'm Connor!</h1>
	<p>I'm from Garderville, Nevada, a small town close to Lake Tahoe along the California-Nevada border. 
	Although I've lived most of my life in Nevada, spending time hiking, climbing, and skiing in
	in the Reno-Tahoe area, I'm now based in Providence, Rhode Island where I study computer science at Brown University.
	I haven't always been interesetd in programming. I was lucky to have an amazing introduction to computer science through
	cs0150, the largest intro cs class at Brown, which helped me fall in love with the subject. It was challenging in ways
	I'd never expected or experienced, but it was so worth it, especially because of the support of the incredible TA staff.
	I went on to become a teaching assistant for the course in the following fall of 2018, striving to help others
	find a passion for programming the same way I had. Since then, I've developed my passion for tech-education by spending
	the summer of 2019 teaching teaching kids to code at Camp EDMO in San Francisco, California. Camp EDMO was an incredibly
	rewarding experience because I had the privelege of working with middle schoolers. This younger age group brought such
	great energy and creativity to the teaching experience. I'm now looking to work in industry to develop tech-education tools.
	The development of educational resources is an interest of mine that I'm am excited to puruse. Connect with me on Linkedin
	and Github to check out my projects. You can reach me by email as well.
