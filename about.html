	<h1>Hi there, I'm Connor!</h1>
	<p>I'm from Garderville, Nevada.
	Although I've lived most of my life in Nevada, spending time hiking, climbing, and skiing in
	in the Reno-Tahoe area, I'm now based in Providence, Rhode Island where I study computer science at Brown University.
	I haven't always been interested in programming. I was lucky to have an amazing introduction to computer science through
		<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/info/csci0150/cs0150">cs0150</a>
	which helped me fall in love with the subject. It was challenging in ways
	I'd never expected or experienced, but it was so worth it. I went on to become a ta for the course in the
	following fall of 2018, striving to help others
	find a passion for programming the same way I had. Since then, I've pursued my interest in tech-education by spending
	the summer of 2019 teaching teaching kids to code at Camp EDMO in San Francisco, California. It was an incredibly
	rewarding experience, working with middle schoolers who brought great energy and creativity to the teaching experience.
	I'm now looking to work in industry to develop tech-education tools.
